# Making BGP data plane aware
Repository of the Master's thesis of Emilie Deprez at UCLouvain, under the supervision of Pr. Olivier Bonaventure. The objective was to explore the possibility and implications of adding knowledge from the data plane in BGP. This master thesis is divided into two parts. In the first part, we asked ourselves if it is possible to modify the behavior of BGP when we add information about the data plane. We took the case of a planned administrative shutdown. We added a new well-known community, the PLANNED_SHUTDOWN that is advertised for a route that will be shut down soon and there is an alternative route. With this information, we tried to reduce the number of BGP messages sent between ASes. The code of the solution and to perform measurement is available in the folder `Part1: Planned Administrative Shutdown`. In the second part, we wanted to directly measure in the data plane and use the results in the BGP decision process. We have created the RQM, Route Quality Measurement, that performs the measurement. We have also developed a communication protocol between the RQM and BGP to transfer quality information. The code of the solution and to perform measurements is available in the folder `Part2: BGP Route Quality Measurement`.
